# DESCRIPTION

If statements linked to else statements are part of the fundamentals of coding. The challenge is to design the best condition.

A condition controls which part of your code is executed. if contains what to do if the condition is true, and else contains what to do if the condition is not met.

## An example:
```c
let earth_is_flat = false;

if earth_is_flat {
  println!("Science doesn't exist");
} else {
  println!("Phew.");
}
Replace/Complete the following code so that we know whether 10 is less than or greater than 20. (The XX is what you need to replace)
```

FUNCTION PROTOTYPE (C)

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int nbr = 10;

  if (XX) {
    printf("nbr is greater than 20\n");
  }
  else {
    printf("nbr is less than 20\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Example 00
```bash
Input: 
Output: nbr is less than 20

Return Value: nil
```
