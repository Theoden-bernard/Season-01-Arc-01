# DESCRIPTION

What is a string? Is it a word? How can a computer create a string? It could be defined by "multiple letters", which is translated to multiple "characters." Is it an array of characters? :-)

Replace/Complete the following code. Create a variable with (if needed) the right type. (The XX is what you need to replace)

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  XX = "Learning is growing";

  printf("%s\n", my_string);
  return 0;
}
```

Input: 
Output: Learning is growing

Return Value: nil
```
