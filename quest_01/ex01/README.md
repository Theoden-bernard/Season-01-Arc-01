# DESCRIPTION

The first part of coding is to create a variable. Let's get started with an integer variable. What does integer variable mean? In most languages, you have types. A good example is that a letter is different from a number. In a computer, everything is numbers (0 and 1) but we, as humans, interact with letters (and words) to make them usable there are conventions. A letter is a number and one of these conversion tables is ASCII. (You should Google man ASCII.)

Enough talking!

Replace/Complete the following code. Create a variable with (if needed) the right type. (The XX is what you need to replace)

## FUNCTION PROTOTYPE (C)

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  XX = 34;

  printf("%d\n", person_age);
  return 0;
}
```

## Example 00
```bash
Input: 
Output: 34

Return Value: nil
```
