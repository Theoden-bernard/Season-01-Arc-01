# DESCRIPTION

Repeating is annoying, which is why we could create a program for it. :)

Implement a while loop to print 100 times "I want to code". (Don't forget to increment the index ;-))

Replace/Complete the following code. (The XX is what you need to replace)

## FUNCTION PROTOTYPE (C)

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int index = 0;

  while (XX) {
    printf("I want to code\n");
    XX
  }
  return 0;
}
```

## Example 00
```bash
Input:
