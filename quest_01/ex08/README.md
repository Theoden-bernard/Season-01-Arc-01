# DESCRIPTION

The syntax is only a small part of what you need to learn to write quality code. Software Architecture (Designing Software) is really the core part of each project and being a good engineer.

In order to "organize" your code, functions are the key. Let's dive in to functions!

Replace/Complete the following code. (The XX is what you need to replace)

## FUNCTION PROTOTYPE (C)

```c
#include <stdio.h>
// Following XXXXXX will be a function that will print using printf("my_first_function\n");
XXXXXX
XXXXXX
XXXXXX

int main() {
  my_first_function();

  return 0;
}
```

Example 00
```bash
Input: 
Output: my_first_function

Return Value: nil
```
