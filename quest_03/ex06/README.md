# DESCRIPTION

Implement strStr().

It should return a pointer to the first occurrence of a needle in a haystack, or NULL if the needle is not part of the haystack.
---
### Clarification:

What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return haystack when needle is an empty string.
