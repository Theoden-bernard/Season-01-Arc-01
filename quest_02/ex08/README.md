# DESCRIPTION

Create a my_string_index function which takes 2 parameters (haystack and needle) and locates the first occurrence of the character needle in the string haystack and returns the position.

You can think of this function as: is there an L (character) in my string "helLo"?

The objective is to build a loop that has an if statement which returns the characters position when it matches the right character.

## FUNCTION PROTOTYPE (C)

```c
int my_string_index(char* param_1, char param_2)
{

}
```

## Example 00
```bash
Input: "hello" && "l"
Output:

```
## Example 01
```bash

Output:

```
